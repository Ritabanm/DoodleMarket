Here’s a rewritten version of the documentation for your React application, making it more concise, modern, and tailored to your specific project:

---

# **Doodle Market - React Application**

Doodle Market is a React-based e-commerce platform for buying and selling creative drawings using fake currency. The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

---

## **Getting Started**

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

### **1. Clone the Repository**
Clone the project from GitHub:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/DoodleMarket.git
cd DoodleMarket
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**
Install all necessary packages using:
```bash
npm install
```

### **3. Run the Application**
Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```
This will open the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. The app automatically reloads when you save changes.

---

## **Available Scripts**

### **`npm start`**
Runs the app in development mode. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### **`npm test`**
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. Learn more about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### **`npm run build`**
Builds the app for production in the `build/` folder. The build is optimized for the best performance. The output files are minified, and filenames include hashes for cache busting.

### **`npm run eject`**
Ejects the configuration files (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) to allow full customization. **Note:** This is irreversible.
